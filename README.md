# ECS Fargate Example with AWS CDK

This project demonstrates how to deploy a containerized application on AWS using Amazon ECS with the Fargate launch type. The project uses AWS CDK to define the infrastructure as code. We will create a VPC, ECS Cluster, Fargate Task Definition, Fargate Service, and an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic.

## Overview

Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) is a container orchestration service that helps you deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. With ECS, you can run your containers on:
- **EC2 instances** (where you manage the server infrastructure), or
- **AWS Fargate** (a serverless compute engine where AWS manages the underlying infrastructure).

In this project, we use Fargate so that you can focus on your containerized application without worrying about managing servers.

## Key Concepts

### Amazon ECS
- **What It Is:** A managed container orchestration service.
- **Role:** Deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications.
- **Launch Types:** 
  - **EC2:** You manage the underlying EC2 instances.
  - **Fargate:** AWS manages the compute resources.

### Fargate
- **What It Is:** A serverless compute engine for containers.
- **Benefits:** 
  - No need to provision, manage, or scale EC2 instances.
  - Simplifies container deployment and operations.
- **Usage:** Specify the container resource requirements and let AWS handle the rest.

### Tasks
- **Definition:** The basic unit of work in ECS.
- **Task Definition:** A blueprint that specifies:
  - Which container image to run.
  - CPU and memory allocation.
  - Port mappings, environment variables, and other settings.
- **Usage:** You can run a task as a one-off job (batch processing) or as part of a service.

### Services
- **Definition:** A higher-level construct that manages one or more tasks.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Ensures a specified number of tasks (desired count) are running.
  - Automatically replaces tasks if they fail.
  - Can integrate with load balancers to distribute traffic.
- **Usage:** Ideal for long-running applications (web apps, APIs) that require high availability.

## CDK Code Breakdown

Below is the complete CDK code with explanations for each step.

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import * as ec2 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2';
import * as ecs from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-ecs';
import * as elbv2 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-elasticloadbalancingv2';

export class EcsFargateStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // 1. Create a VPC
    const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, 'MyVpc', {
      maxAzs: 2, // Spread across 2 Availability Zones for high availability.
    });

    // 2. Create an ECS Cluster within the VPC
    const cluster = new ecs.Cluster(this, 'MyCluster', {
      vpc,
    });

    // 3. Define a Fargate Task Definition
    const taskDefinition = new ecs.FargateTaskDefinition(this, 'MyTaskDef', {
      memoryLimitMiB: 512, // 512 MiB of memory allocated.
      cpu: 256,            // 256 CPU units allocated.
    });

    // 4. Add a container to the task definition.
    // Here we use a sample container image from Amazon.
    const container = taskDefinition.addContainer('MyContainer', {
      image: ecs.ContainerImage.fromRegistry('amazon/amazon-ecs-sample'),
      logging: ecs.LogDrivers.awsLogs({ streamPrefix: 'MyApp' }),
    });

    // Expose port 80 on the container.
    container.addPortMappings({
      containerPort: 80,
    });

    // 5. Create a Fargate Service that uses the task definition
    const fargateService = new ecs.FargateService(this, 'MyFargateService', {
      cluster,
      taskDefinition,
      desiredCount: 2, // The service will ensure 2 tasks are always running.
    });

    // 6. Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) for your service
    const lb = new elbv2.ApplicationLoadBalancer(this, 'LB', {
      vpc,
      internetFacing: true, // Makes the load balancer accessible from the internet.
    });

    // Add a listener on port 80.
    const listener = lb.addListener('Listener', {
      port: 80,
      open: true, // Allows traffic from any source.
    });

    // 7. Attach the Fargate Service to the ALB
    listener.addTargets('ECS', {
      port: 80,
      targets: [fargateService],
      healthCheck: {
        path: '/', // Health check endpoint.
        interval: cdk.Duration.seconds(30), // Health check interval.
      },
    });

    // Optional: Output the Load Balancer DNS for easy access.
    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'LoadBalancerDNS', {
      value: lb.loadBalancerDnsName,
    });
  }
}
```

## Detailed Explanation

### 1. Creating a VPC

**Purpose:**  
The VPC provides a secure, isolated network for all your AWS resources.

**Detail:**  
The VPC is created to span 2 Availability Zones, which increases the resilience and availability of your application by spreading resources across multiple data centers.

**Code Insight:**
```typescript
const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, 'MyVpc', { maxAzs: 2 });
  ```
  - `maxAzs: 2` ensures high availability by spreading resources across two Availability Zones.

---

### 2. Creating an ECS Cluster

**Purpose:**  
The ECS Cluster is a logical grouping of your ECS resources (tasks and services) and serves as the foundation for running containerized applications.

**Detail:**  
The cluster is created inside the VPC, ensuring that networking between the tasks and other resources is secure and isolated.

**Code Insight:**
```typescript
const cluster = new ecs.Cluster(this, 'MyCluster', { vpc });
```

---

### 3. Defining a Fargate Task Definition

**Purpose:**  
This step creates a blueprint for your containerized application. It details the container image to use, the CPU and memory requirements, and other configurations.

**Detail:**  
You specify that the task should use 512 MiB of memory and 256 CPU units.

**Code Insight:**
```typescript
const taskDefinition = new ecs.FargateTaskDefinition(this, 'MyTaskDef', {
  memoryLimitMiB: 512,
  cpu: 256,
});
```

---

### 4. Adding a Container to the Task Definition

**Purpose:**  
Defines the actual container that will run inside the task.

**Detail:**  
A sample container image (`amazon/amazon-ecs-sample`) is used for demonstration. In production, replace this with your container image (e.g., one containing your Node.js or React.js application).  
Logging is set up so that container logs are sent to CloudWatch with the prefix `"MyApp"`.

**Code Insight:**
```typescript
const container = taskDefinition.addContainer('MyContainer', {
  image: ecs.ContainerImage.fromRegistry('amazon/amazon-ecs-sample'),
  logging: ecs.LogDrivers.awsLogs({ streamPrefix: 'MyApp' }),
});
container.addPortMappings({ containerPort: 80 });
```

---

### 5. Creating a Fargate Service

**Purpose:**  
The Fargate Service ensures that a defined number of tasks are always running.

**Detail:**  
It maintains 2 running instances of the task and automatically replaces any tasks that fail. This provides high availability for your application.

**Code Insight:**
```typescript
const fargateService = new ecs.FargateService(this, 'MyFargateService', {
  cluster,
  taskDefinition,
  desiredCount: 2,
});
```

---

### 6. Setting Up an Application Load Balancer (ALB)

**Purpose:**  
The ALB distributes incoming traffic to your running tasks and performs health checks.

**Detail:**  
The ALB is created inside the same VPC and is internet-facing, meaning it can receive traffic from outside your VPC. A listener is configured to accept traffic on port 80.

**Code Insight:**
```typescript
const lb = new elbv2.ApplicationLoadBalancer(this, 'LB', {
  vpc,
  internetFacing: true,
});
const listener = lb.addListener('Listener', {
  port: 80,
  open: true,
});
```

---

### 7. Attaching the Fargate Service to the ALB

**Purpose:**  
Connects the Fargate Service to the ALB so that incoming traffic is routed to the tasks.

**Detail:**  
Health checks are configured to monitor the health of the tasks, ensuring that traffic is only sent to healthy instances.

**Code Insight:**
```typescript
listener.addTargets('ECS', {
  port: 80,
  targets: [fargateService],
  healthCheck: {
    path: '/',
    interval: cdk.Duration.seconds(30),
  },
});
```

---

### 8. Outputting the Load Balancer DNS

**Purpose:**  
Provides the DNS name of the load balancer as an output, making it easy to access your application.

**Detail:**  
This output can be used to open your application in a web browser.

**Code Insight:**
```typescript
new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'LoadBalancerDNS', {
  value: lb.loadBalancerDnsName,
});
```

---

## How It All Works Together

- **Networking:**  
  The VPC creates a secure network across multiple Availability Zones, ensuring redundancy.

- **Container Orchestration:**  
  The ECS Cluster groups your containerized applications. The Fargate Task Definition specifies what your container does, and the Fargate Service ensures that a set number of tasks are always running.

- **Traffic Management:**  
  The Application Load Balancer distributes incoming requests to the healthy tasks, ensuring that your application is highly available and can scale based on traffic.

Together, these components create a robust, scalable, and highly available environment for your containerized application.
