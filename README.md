# AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) Guide

## What is AWS CDK?

AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) is a framework that lets you define cloud infrastructure using familiar programming languages. Instead of writing YAML or JSON templates, you can use TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, or Go to define your AWS resources.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

### What is IaC?
Infrastructure as Code is the practice of managing cloud infrastructure using code instead of manually configuring resources through a console.

### Benefits
- **Version Control**: Track changes to your infrastructure
- **Repeatability**: Create identical environments easily
- **Automation**: Automate deployment processes
- **Documentation**: Code serves as documentation
- **Testing**: Test infrastructure changes before applying them
- **Consistency**: Reduce human errors in deployment

## Comparison with Other IaC Tools

### AWS CDK
- **Pros**: 
  - Use familiar programming languages
  - Strong type checking and IDE support
  - Reusable components (constructs)
- **Best for**: Teams comfortable with modern programming languages

### CloudFormation
- **Pros**:
  - Native AWS service
  - Well-established and stable
- **Best for**: Teams who prefer declarative templates

### Terraform
- **Pros**:
  - Multi-cloud support
  - Large community
  - Rich ecosystem
- **Best for**: Multi-cloud deployments

## Core Concepts

### Constructs
Building blocks of CDK applications. Three levels:
1. **L1 (Low Level)**: Direct CloudFormation resources
2. **L2 (Medium Level)**: AWS opinionated abstractions
3. **L3 (High Level)**: Multi-resource patterns

### Stacks
- Deployable units of infrastructure
- Similar to CloudFormation stacks
- Can be deployed to multiple environments

### Apps
- Container for one or more stacks
- Entry point of your CDK application

### Assets
- Additional files needed by your infrastructure
- Examples: Lambda functions, Docker images

## CDK CLI Commands

```bash
# Initialize a new CDK project
cdk init app --language typescript

# Generate CloudFormation template
cdk synth

# Deploy stack to AWS
cdk deploy

# Compare local changes with deployed stack
cdk diff

# Remove stack from AWS
cdk destroy
```

## Best Practices

### TypeScript Best Practices
1. Use strong typing
2. Create reusable constructs
3. Use props interfaces
4. Implement proper error handling
5. Follow naming conventions

### General CDK Best Practices
1. Use environment-specific configurations
2. Implement tagging strategies
3. Use constants for repeated values
4. Break down large stacks
5. Use aspects for cross-cutting concerns

## How CDK Works

### Template Synthesis
1. CDK code is executed locally
2. Generates CloudFormation template
3. Template is deployed to AWS

### Resource Management
- Each resource has a logical ID
- CDK handles resource updates and replacements
- Uses CloudFormation change sets

## Common Use Cases

1. **Web Applications**: Create VPC, ECS clusters, Load Balancers
2. **Serverless Apps**: Lambda functions, API Gateway, DynamoDB
3. **Data Lakes**: S3 buckets, Glue jobs, Athena queries
4. **CI/CD Pipelines**: CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy
